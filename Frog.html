        <h1>ABOUT EXTINCT FROG</h1>
        <p>
            If you pass by a stream, a lake, a forest, or a pond, chances are, you’ll encounter one of our froggy pals hopping around or hear them ribbit. Typically, the male gender croaks more often to attract mates. On the other hand, female frogs – the quieter of this fascinating species – remain silent, only croaking to mark their territories or when in pain.
            As the most common amphibian critters, frogs live on every continent save Antarctica, although a fossil frog was once found there. These bold, intuitive animals boast diverse and unique adaptations to help them thrive in any environment. These include long legs – which allow them to leap 20-50 times their body length to catch prey and escape predators, camouflage, webbed feet, and toxins.

            And did you know frogs have been around for more than 250 million years, even before the fierce, deadly dinosaurs first appeared on earth? Sadly, some of these amphibian species are now endangered, and others have long since vanished. In this article, we’ll explore 13 types of these now extinct frogs.

                Geographic Range
                The golden toad once occupied a small area of 4 km2 of elfin cloud forest on the Cordillera de Tilaran in northern Costa Rica. This area is now known as the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve (Pounds, 1996).

                Habitat
                The golden toad occupies a wet, montane area of the forest in northern Costa Rica. The elevation of this habitat ranges from 2000 -- 2100 meters (Jacobson, 1991).

                Physical Description
                The golden toad is an extreme example of a sexually dimorphic amphibian. The males possess a very striking orange coloration. The females are black with scarlet blotches edged in yellow. The females range in length from 42 -- 56 mm while the males are 39 -- 48 mm. The striking physical differences between male and female cannot be determined until adulthood. Juveniles tend to be unsexable since they carry similar characteristics and body size (Jacobson, 1991).

                Development
                Development - Life Cyclemetamorphosis
                Reproduction
                The golden toad is an explosive breeder during the months of April through June in which there is a heavy rainy season. The toads gather in enormous numbers around small, temporary pools and other water-filled depressions that are located within the forest. During this time, the competition between males for females is quite fierce. The males generally outnumber the females by an 8:1 ratio. It is at this time that males will mate with almost any moving object and molest other pairs that were in amplexus. Males also exhibited a behavior known as "toad balls" in which 4-10 males would clasp each other. However, a successful mating would produce around 200 to 400 eggs. The large diameter of the eggs is around 3.0 mm (Jacobson, 1991) The larval forms are all unsexable because of the same size and color. They remain in the pool and take up to 5 weeks to metamorphose (Harding, 1993).

                Key Reproductive Featuresgonochoric/gonochoristic/dioecious (sexes separate).

                Torrent frogs are an interesting group of frogs found in the rainforests of north-east Australia.
                There are four species in the group: the Mountain Mistfrog (Litoria nyakalensis), the Armoured Mistfrog
                (Litoria lorica), the Waterfall Frog (Litoria nannotis) and the Common Mistfrog (Litoria rheocola).

                All of these species were once abundant along streams in the Wet Tropics region of northeastern Queensland.
                In the late 1980s and early 1990s the populations suffered dramatic declines. The Mountain and Armoured mistfrogs,
                both localised species from the uplands, disappeared completely. The two more widespread species disappeared from the uplands but remain lower down.

                All four species are well adapted to life on mountain streams, hence the name. The adult frogs live around
                fast-flowing sections of streams, near waterfalls and cascades. The Armoured Mistfrog and the Waterfall Frog
                live only near the splash zones of waterfalls, sticking to the wet rocks and jumping in the rushing water when disturbed.

                The frogs feed on invertebrates around the stream and in neighbouring forest. Torrent frog tadpoles have discs
                around their mouths, allowing them cling to rocks in fast-flowing streams and graze on algae.

                A relatively small frog, males range in length from 31–33 mm and females from 45–51 mm. The head is wider than long.
                Snout pointed with sharp canthus rostralis. Dilated finger and toe tips are characteristic. Webbing in feet almost complete,
                touching the toe pad on all digits except fourth. Webbing in hand partial with webbing reaching the second sub-articular
                tubercle on finger three. Skin smooth on dorsum, granulated on chest and venter. Variable in skin coloration but broadly
                ranges from pale grey-green to brown. Dark crossbars are common on dorsum near the vent and on legs. Sides of the body and
                inner surface of the legs are yellow with black blotches.
                Often, few fawn colored blotches are found on snout. Iris brown, often with a tinge of blue.
                This species is thought be found in Sumatra and Malaysian Borneo. However, the record from Sumatra warrants scrutiny. It is commonly found in the Crocker Range and Mt. Kinabalu National Park.

                It is found in primary rainforests along rocky streams above 1000 m above sea level. Males vocalize perched on small saplings and trees overhanging streams.
                Tadpoles are known to live in shallow areas of stream underneath gravel.

                The Sierra de Omoa Streamside Frog (Craugastor omoaensis) is an extinct species of brittle-belly frog formerly endemic to
                the subtropical and tropical moist montane forests, rivers, and intermittent rivers of Sierra de Omoa in Honduras,
                along with 12 other species of amphibians and reptiles indigenous to the region.Discovered at an unknown time but first
                described in 1997, it was never greatly studied with only 24 species studied. It was considered to be last seen in 1974,
                and in 2004 it was classified as critically endangered despite it having almost completely disappeared since 1996; its
                disappearance has been attributed to a combination of a fungal Chytridiomycosis infection (a fungal infection caused by both
                Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) to blame as a possible reason, combined with habitat
                loss. With no sightings since 2004, it was officially declared extinct as of 2019, the same year as another brittle-belly frog,
                the Corquin Robber Frog.

                Oophaga speciosa has a snout-vent length ranging from 28-31 mm. it is relatively large and has its inner tarsal fold reduced to a tubercle (Savage 1986). Its skin is smooth except for the posterior belly and the ventral surface of the thighs. The tympanum is round, with a diameter slightly greater than one half the diameter of the eye (Silverstone 1975).

                Coloration: Its color in life is red. In preservative, it is entirely gray except for a few possible light spots (Silverstone 1975).
                Splendid Poison Frog hails from Panama, in a small geographic range found near the western Cordillera de Talamanca Central, adjacent to Costa Rica, at around 1370 m above sea level. It is mainly a terrestrial species that is found in the humid lowlands and very wet montane forest (Stuart et al. 2008).

                Life History, Abundance, Activity, and Special Behaviors
                Oophaga speciosa is diurnal.

                This frog exhibits uniparental care. Females deposit eggs in leaf litter, and once the eggs hatch, the females carry the tadpoles to small accumulations of water, formed in the leaf/stem axils of plants. Females return to feed tadpoles with infertile eggs (Summers 1999).

                It is common for males to be very aggressive when defending territories for foraging and oviposition sites (Wells 2007).

                Atelopus senex (common name: pass stubfoot toad) is an extinct species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It was endemic to Costa Rica and known from the Cordillera Central and Cordillera de Talamanca at elevations of 1,100–2,200 m (3,600–7,200 ft) asl.

                Description
                Males measure 28–32 mm (1.1–1.3 in) and females 30–43 mm (1.2–1.7 in) in snout–vent length. Males are bluish gray, blue-green, black, or occasionally greenish, without patterning. Females may have patterning consisting of cream, lemon, or lime-coloured lighter areas.

                Habitat and conservation
                Its natural habitats are stream margins in premontane and lower montane rainforests. It was formerly abundant but has seen a drastic population decline. Last seen in 1986, it might already be extinct. Its decline is likely to have been caused by chytridiomycosis, although climate change, pet trade, and pollution are also possible threats.

                Pseudophilautus variabilis, also known as the variable bush frog or variable bubble-nest frog, is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. This now extinct species was endemic to Sri Lanka. Despite extensive searches in recent times, it is only known from collections prior to 1858. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown but probably involve habitat loss.

                Taxonomy
                Pseudophilautus variabilis is only known with certainty from its lectotype.The original type series consisted of ten syntypes, probably representing collections from several locations but without more specific information on their origins than "Ceylon". Therefore, the female illustrated in the species description was chosen as the lectotype in 2001. One of the paralectotypes was in 2007 described as a new species, Pseudophilautus pardus, by Meegaskumbura and colleagues.

                Pseudophilautus wynaadensis from India has sometimes been mixed with this species.

                Description
                The lectotype of Pseudophilautus variabilis is an adult female that measures 36–37 mm (1.4–1.5 in) in snout–vent length. The body is moderately elongate. The tympanum is rather indistinct while the supra-tympanic fold is distinct. The fingers and toes are moderately long; fingers have dermal fringes but no webbing whereas toes are medially webbed.

                The mountain mist frog, Henrietta Creek tree frog or Nyakala frog (Ranoidea nyakalensis) is a frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland between 380 and 1020 metres above sea level.[2][3][4]

                This frog lives in and near streams where the water flowed so fast that it turned white. Scientists saw the adult frogs sitting on rocks or leaves near the streams.

                The tadpoles live in the fast water. Scientists wrote that they had strong tails for swimming and bodies meant for the water to flow over them. Sometimes they would dig into the sand to hold on during floods. The tadpoles would spend the winter in mountain streams and grow into frogs in the spring.

                This frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists last saw the adult frog and tadpoles in 1990. They saw them in the Carbine Tableland.

                Scientists think pigs that escaped from humans might be one reason why the frog is endangered. The pigs rip up the streams where the frog would live. They also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs. Scientists also thought habitat loss, human beings building roads and farms where the frog would live, was killing the frogs, but the Australian government protected the frogs' home in 1988.

                Atelopus chiriquiensis, the Chiriqui Harlequin Frog, is a moderately-sized frog with males reaching 28-34 mm and females 36-49 mm (Savage 2002). The head is angular and longer than it is wide, and lacks a visible tympanum (Savage 2002). The canthus rostralis is well-defined in this species (Savage 2002). The undersides of the hands and feet are wrinkled and fleshy (Savage 2002). Paired metarsal and subarticular tubercles are present. Toes have extensive webbing. Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single subgular vocal sac, located internally, as well as brown nuptial pads on the thumbs (Savage 2002). Occasionally adults of either sex will have prominent small spicules along the anterior flank (Savage 2002).

                This species is highly variable in color. Males have a uniformly yellow, chartreuse, lime green or brownish red coloration (Leenders 2001; Savage 2002). On occasion males will also have a pattern consisting of thin black reticulations, or fine dark vermiculations (Savage 2002). Females are more variable in color, and are rarely similar to the males in coloration (Savage 2002). Many females have an orange or orange-red stripe, outlined in black, which begins at the snout and then splits into two stripes running down the sides of the back to the groin (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001). The stripes may also break up into long splotches (Savage 2002). In both sexes the ventrum is usually yellow, and generally without pattern; females sometimes have a broad black and red reticulum ventrally (Savage 2002). Both females and males have orangish or greenish eye color, and sometimes they may even have an eye of each color (Leenders 2001). The iris is gold (Savage 2002).

                This species has weakly developed and relatively inconspicuous poison glands, which are scattered over the head and dorsum (Leenders 2001), distinguishing it from related species. In contrast, Atelopus varius has no differentiated glandular areas, and Atelopus senex has very prominent glands (Savage 2002).
                chiriquiensis tadpoles are gastromyzophorous, with 2/3 denticle rows, and resemble those of Atelopus varius (Savage 2002).

                Across Central and South America—from Costa Rica in the north, to Bolivia in the south, and in nine countries in between—the
                streams and forests are speckled with the colors of the rainbow. This is thanks to a diverse and vibrant group of amphibians
                called harlequin toads. These beautiful and charismatic toads come in orange, red, green, yellow, brown, black and sometimes even purple, earning them the nickname “clown frogs.”
                In some places, harlequin toads have been imbued with tremendous cultural value. In Panama, the striking Panamanian Golden Toad (Atelopus zeteki) is the national animal, found on lottery tickets and artwork in markets, and celebrated once a year through a government decree that declared Panamanian Golden Toad Day every Aug. 14. Harlequin toads also have cultural significance for some Indigenous communities, including those in Colombia’s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, who consider frogs to be a symbol of fertility and ecosystem health. Outside of these examples, however, harlequin toads receive little public attention but are among the most imperiled species in the world.

                Two years ago, Mike Archer from the University of New South Wales looked down a microscope and saw that a single fertilised frog egg had divided in two. Then, it did it again. And again. Eventually, the egg produced an embryo containing hundreds of cells.

                “There were a lot of hi-fives going around the laboratory,” says Archer.

                This might seem like an over-reaction. After all, millions of frog eggs divide into embryos every day, as they have done since before dinosaurs walked the earth. But this egg was special. Archer’s team of scientists had loaded it with the DNA of the southern gastric brooding frog—a bizarre creature that has been extinct for almost 30 years.

                The fact that it started to grow into an embryo was a big deal. The fact that it never went further was disappointing, but not unexpected. This is cutting-edge science—cloning techniques put to the purpose of resurrection.

                Archer’s goal is simple: To bring the extinct gastric brooding frog back from oblivion and, in doing so, provide hope for the hundreds of other frogs that are heading that way. Getting the embryo was a milestone and Archer is buoyantly optimistic that he’ll cross the finish line soon. Lazarus, he says, will rise again.

    <h1>12.SHARP SNOUTED DAY FROG </h1>

                The sharp snouted day frog is the most visually distinctive member of its genus. It is a small frog with a narrow wedge-shaped snout that is acutely pointed and protrudes well beyond the lower jaw. There appears to be two different types of call, one likened to a metallic tinkling, repeated a number of times in quick succession, and the other more like a chirp. Male sharp snouted day frogs seem to form territories, although this may be a response to the dramatic population declines, and resultant low numbers of females.

                The Taudactylus genus of frogs, to which this species belongs, diverged from all other amphibians over 65 million years ago. This means this group of frogs has been evolving in isolation since before the extinction of the dinosaurs!

                The sharp snouted day frog is just one species out of many in northeastern Australia which have been affected by the chytrid fungus. The disease is thought to have caused a series of frog population declines and extinctions across the region. A relatively large proportion of this species’ habitat is covered by national parks, but the lack of sightings of the species since 1997 indicates the sharp snouted day frog may now be extinct.

    <h1>13.AUSTRALIAN TORRENT FROG </h1>

                Torrent frogs are an interesting group of frogs found in the rainforests of north-east Australia. There are four species in the group: the Mountain Mistfrog (Litoria nyakalensis), the Armoured Mistfrog (Litoria lorica), the Waterfall Frog (Litoria nannotis) and the Common Mistfrog (Litoria rheocola).

                All of these species were once abundant along streams in the Wet Tropics region of northeastern Queensland. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the populations suffered dramatic declines. The Mountain and Armoured mistfrogs, both localised species from the uplands, disappeared completely. The two more widespread species disappeared from the uplands but remain lower down.

                All four species are well adapted to life on mountain streams, hence the name. The adult frogs live around fast-flowing sections of streams, near waterfalls and cascades. The Armoured Mistfrog and the Waterfall Frog live only near the splash zones of waterfalls, sticking to the wet rocks and jumping in the rushing water when disturbed.

                The frogs feed on invertebrates around the stream and in neighbouring forest. Torrent frog tadpoles have discs around their mouths, allowing them cling to rocks in fast-flowing streams and graze on algae.
