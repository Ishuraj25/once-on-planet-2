        Explore the fascinating world of extinct fishes, where ancient aquatic species once thrived but now exist only in the pages of history. These remarkable creatures, with unique adaptations and evolutionary features, roamed the oceans and freshwater ecosystems for millions of years. Unfortunately, factors such as environmental changes, habitat destruction, and over-exploitation led to the extinction of these extraordinary fish species. From the jaw-dropping Dunkleosteus, an armored fish of the Devonian era, to the mysterious Xiphactinus from the Cretaceous period, each extinct fish tells a tale of survival and adaptation in Earth's ever-changing environment. Join us on a journey through time as we uncover the stories behind these vanished aquatic wonders and reflect on the importance of conservation to protect the diversity of life in our oceans and waterways.

                            Silver trout are a type of ray-finned char, and they’ve been extinct since 1939. They were about a foot long and olive green in color, which is surprising since silver is in their name.
                            Introduced invasive species finished this trout off, which was already rare on its own accord. It was endemic to a few areas of New Hampshire. Silver trout were a type of brook trout.

                            The Yellowfin Cutthroat Trout sounds like a legend straight out of the American West. This 10-pound trout, sporting bright yellow fins was first spotted in the Twin Lakes of Colorado during the late 19th century. As it turns out, the Yellowfin wasn't the hallucination of some drunken cowboy, but an actual trout subspecies described by a pair of academics in the 1891 Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission. Unfortunately, the Yellowfin Cutthroat Trout was doomed by the introduction of the more fecund Rainbow Trout in the early 20th century. It is, however, survived by its close relative, the smaller Greenback Cutthroat Trout.

                            It was decided that this species was extinct in 2008, though the last recorded sighting was in the late 1800s. As the name implies, it was found in Ukraine. Other types of lampreys all over the world are also facing extinction for a variety of reasons.
                            Lampreys lack a skeleton, including jaws. They can’t use their mouths to move water across their gills so they can breathe, so they rely on the natural movement of water.
                            Lampreys need swift-moving water and lose embankments for breeding and survival. Things like dams for hydropower or other modifications to naturally flowing rivers hinder the life cycle of lampreys.

                            A salmonid fish and hence closely related to salmon and trout, the Blackfin Cisco was once plentiful in the Great Lakes, but recently succumbed to a combination of overfishing and predation by not one, but three, invasive species: the Alewife, the Rainbow Smelt, and a genus of sea lamprey. The Blackfin Cisco didn't disappear from the Great Lakes all overnight: the last attested Lake Huron sighing was in 1960; the last Lake Michigan sighting in 1969; and the last known sighting of all, near Thunder Bay, Ontario, was in 2006.

                            Snake River suckers lived in the upper Snake River basin in lakes near Jackson Hole, WY. After the Jackson Lake Dam was constructed, it was found only below the dam. Presumably, it used to have a larger range than it was provided before humanization.
                            Suckers migrate into certain streams to spawn their young in gravel, leaving them. The interruption of these migration routes is the culprit in the extinction of this species.

                            This fish was old from an evolutionary standpoint, having been the same for 200 million years. Human endeavors like overfishing and habitat destruction ended this fish’s long legacy on earth.

The last known specimen was sighted in the early 1980s. It wasn't only overfishing that led to the Blue Walleye's demise. Also to blame were the introduction of an invasive species, the Rainbow Smelt, and industrial pollution from surrounding factories. Many people claim to have caught Blue Walleyes, but experts believe those fish were actually blue-tinged Yellow Walleyes, which are not extinct.

                            This freshwater sculpin was endemic to Utah Lake, which is in central Utah. Utah lake is part of the system that feeds the Great Salt Lake via the Jordan River tributary. The lake itself is slightly saline due to evaporation, but it’s not anything on the scale compared to the Great Salt Lake.
                            Utah lake sculpins are survived by a close relative called the Bear Lake sculpin, which is endemic to a different lake in Utah. Utah lake sculpins were bottom dwellers that chowed down on invertebrates.
                            This species was last seen in 1928. It’s believed that shallow water from a drought coupled with a cold winter is what froze the lake more than usual. Agricultural runoff decreasing water quality is also a culprit.

                            Human industry drove the Santa Cruz pupfish to extinction like most of our 9 extinct fish. It used to live in the Santa Cruz River basin in Arizona, but changes to this ecosystem pushed them to a natural spring called Monkey Spring. There, the introduced game fish killed the remaining pupfish.          
                            They were declared extinct in 2011. Pupfish are known to live in isolated and extreme situations, which makes certain types of them especially vulnerable to extinction. There are 120 different species of pupfish, so we’re hopeful most will survive and carry the torch for those pupfish that have gone before them.

                            The Galapagos Islands are where Charles Darwin laid much of the groundwork for the theory of evolution. Today, this distant archipelago harbors some of the world's most endangered species. The Galapagos Damsel didn't fall victim to human encroachment: rather, this plankton-eating fish never recovered from a temporary increase in local water temperatures that resulted from the El Niño currents of the early 1980s that drastically reduced plankton populations. Some experts harbor the hope that remnants of the species may yet exist off the coast of Peru.
