        Welcome to our Extinct Mammals page, where we embark on a journey through time to explore the lost wonders of the animal kingdom. Witness the incredible diversity of mammals that once roamed our planet but, sadly, are no longer part of our natural world.
        Through knowledge and appreciation, we hope to inspire a commitment to safeguarding the future of the diverse and magnificent mammals that still grace our world.
        Recently extinct mammals are defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as any mammals that have become extinct since the year 1500 CE. Since then, roughly 80 mammal species have become extinct.
        The list of extinct mammals could go on for ages, but each animal has a unique story. With today’s advanced research, we can learn so much from animals that haven’t even existed during our lifetimes! Here are few mammals that have gone extinct over the years.

                        <p class="card-text">Often referred to as the “saber-toothed tiger,” this mammal is closely related to marsupials. This incredible extinct predatory animal can be most recognized by its two long, razor-sharp canine teeth. These teeth could grow longer than 7 inches and were carefully crafted to cut through tissue, allowing them to inflict the greatest damage on their prey. Not only did they have outstandingly long teeth, but an amazing jaw that could open over 90 degrees. The thylacosmilus was one magnificent animal that, unfortunately, was classified as an extinct mammal.</p>

                            The Pyrenean Ibex was a species of goat that became extinct in the 2000s. These extinct mammals could be found living throughout the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain, France, and mountains throughout Asia and Africa. They chose to live on cliffs to protect themselves from predators. Scientists aren’t entirely sure what caused the Pyrenean Ibex to become extinct, but many believe it could’ve been due to hunting and diseases. Interestingly, scientists tried to clone the Pyrenean Ibex back into existence, but sadly the baby died due to health problems shortly after birth.

It was declared extinct by the IUCN in 2011. The western black rhinoceros was believed to have been genetically different from other rhino subspecies. It was once widespread in the savanna of sub-Saharan Africa, but its numbers declined due to poaching. The western black rhinoceros resided primarily in Cameroon, but surveys since 2006 have failed to locate any individuals.</p>

The eastern cougar (Puma concolor couguar) once roamed the eastern United States from Maine to South Carolina and west from Michigan to Tennessee. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has for years presumed the eastern couger was extinct, having no verifiable evidence, such as DNA, to the contrary. Although many people have seen cougars in the East, and some have taken photographs, the animals sighted may not be the subspecies known as the eastern cougar.</p>

These gigantic mammals were 7 feet tall and had massive antlers atop their head that spanned 12 feet. Just the antlers on their own weighed 90 pounds! These incredible beasts were said to have roamed the earth about 8,000 years ago before becoming extinct. Although scientists don’t know exactly why the Irish elk went extinct, there are a few theories. Some believe its size alone was the reason that contributed to its extinction, while other theories suggest a food shortage might have caused them not to be able to fulfill their dietary needs.</p>

This is because the rear part of its body was all brown, and the front contained a variety of stripes. Each quagga had its own set of individual stripes. The last living quagga resided in the London Zoo throughout the late 1800s.The quagga had incredibly long legs made for endurance and speed, which allowed them to reach over 40 mph. They would also use these incredibly strong legs for defense and give an extremely hard kick if provoked.</p>

Various prey was consumed by these carnivorous mammals, including monkeys and wild boars. They had a beautiful orange fur coat covered with dark and white stripes. The Bali Tiger became extinct in the 1950s due to hunting and destruction of their habitats, making it much harder for them to find prey.

Causes were gill nets, rolling hook fisheries, electrocution, and dynamite fishing. The baiji population declined drastically in decades as China industrialized and made heavy use of the river for fishing, transportation, and hydroelectricity. It has been credibly claimed, after surveys in the Yangtze River during the 1980s, that baiji could be the first dolphin species in history that humans have driven to extinction.</p>

This creature had 3 pairs of horns atop its skull, similar to that of a giraffe. Eobasileus had an incredible pair of strong large tusks on its jaw and lived 45 million years ago.

                            The Thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian Tiger, wasn’t much of a tiger at all. This marsupial mammal was said to resemble more of a medium-sized dog than it did a tiger. These incredible animals weighed anywhere from 30 to 60 pounds and had striking yellowy-brown fur. Thylacines were timid animals that communicated mainly through yaps and barks like dogs. Sadly their extinction was caused at the hands of humans through excessive hunting of the animal. The last Thylacine of its species sadly passed away in 1936 at the Beaumaris Zoo, where it was held in captivity.

                            One of the most well-known extinct animals is the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths are close relatives of modern elephants and were incredible creatures. Unlike elephants today, woolly mammoths had thick brown fur that covered their entire bodies, and this was due to the extremely cold temperatures they lived in. Woolly mammoths became extinct over 10,000 years ago due to climate change, but there are theories to suggest humans may also have been a part of the reason.

These incredible aquatic animals could grow up to lengths of 25 feet and weigh over 8,000 pounds. They were called sea cows because they lived in herds and fed on seagrass near the water’s surface. Sadly this amazing creature became classified as an extinct mammal due to rapid hunting by humans. Sailors and fur traders would hunt them for their fat and meat, and since these sea cows weren’t fast swimmers, this made them an easy target.
