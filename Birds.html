        Over 100 bird species have disappeared since the 1600s mainly due to human activities.
        There are numerous reasons for birds’ extinction including habitat loss, overhunting, and the introduction of non-native predators.
        Flightless birds were particularly vulnerable to extinction as they were unable to escape from predators and as they were often
        endemic to remote islands had had little contact with other animal species so did not have an inbuilt fear. Once their homes were colonised by humans their curiosity got the better of them and they were either hunted to extinction or killed off by introduced predators.

                            Its extinction in the mid-20th century is believed to be caused by the destruction of its habitat as well as human exploitation.
                            As its name suggests, this bird species was highly notable for its enormous white bill resembling ivory. As a result, these woodpeckers were hunted for their bills to be used as decorations.

By the way, "Dodo" probably derives from the Dutch word "dodoor, meaning "sluggard."</p>

Its vast flocks had billions of birds and literally darkened the skies over North America during their annual migrations. Hunted and harassed by the millions — and shipped in railroad cars, by the ton, to the starving cities of the eastern seaboard — the Passenger Pigeon dwindled before vanishing by the late 19th century. The last known Passenger Pigeon, who was named Martha, died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

                            In the Middle East, this bird was widely hunted for its feathers, skin, and eggs. In addition, the large size of these birds makes them ideal as a dinner choice, along with other animals like camels and zebras.
                            During the early 20th century, the population of the Arabian ostrich was greatly reduced as a byproduct of World War II. Finally, the last Arabian ostrich recorded was found in Bahrain in 1941.

                            According to the records, this bird had characteristics of both a quail and a partridge. However, one distinguishing feature of this bird was its broad tail which is relatively long compared to other species of quail in India.
                            This bird was considered as extinct as it was last verified in 1876.

                            The Carolina parakeet, the only parrot endemic to North America, was characterized by having a vibrant green coloration for the majority of its body, bright yellow colored head, and shoulders, and a very distinct orange forehead.
                            Carolina parakeets were considered to be poisonous as animals (like cats) that feed on them die from doing so.
                            During the 1800s, these parakeets had become a serious agricultural pest as they formed loud flocks that would feed on fruits and crops. As a result, enraged farmers held mass slaughter of these birds. The killing and hunting of these birds, combined with the degradation of forests, led to the decline of the bird population.
                            By the 1920s, the Carolina parakeet was extinct. The above image from the Oklahoma Museum shows the dead Carolina Parakeet collected in the 1880s.

                            The Cuban macaw or Cuban red macaw (Ara tricolor) is an extinct species of macaw native to the main island of Cuba and the nearby Isla de la Juventud.
                            Its relationship with other macaws in its genus was long uncertain, but it was thought to have been closely related to the scarlet macaw, which has some similarities in appearance.
                            At about 45–50 centimetres (18–20 in) long, the Cuban macaw was one of the smallest macaws. It had a red, orange, yellow, and white head, and a red, orange, green, brown, and blue body. Little is known of its behaviour, but it is reported to have nested in hollow trees, lived in pairs or families, and fed on seeds and fruits. The species' original distribution on Cuba is unknown, but it may have been restricted to the central and western parts of the island. It was mainly reported from the vast Zapata Swamp, where it inhabited open terrain with scattered trees.
                            It became extinct in the late 19th century. The Cuban macaw was traded and hunted by Native Americans, and by Europeans after their arrival in the 15th century.
